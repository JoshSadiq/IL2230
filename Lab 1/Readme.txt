This readme details how to use the files:
* mlp1.ipynb
* mlp2.ipynb
* lenet5.ipynb

All files are created to download and load MNIST data, create a convolutional neural network model (1-layer MLP, 2-layer MLP, LeNeT-5 architecture-based CNN respectively), train the CNN on the dataset, present the accuracy of the CNN using a testset and finally presenting the memory usage of the network.

Pre-requisities:
* Python environment available
* Pytorch and torchvision installed in environment

If the user has CUDA cores available on their system, the CNN will utilize them automatically and preferably. It will otherwise resort to using the CPU.

Instructions:
* Open the file in preferred IDE (VSCode, Google Colab, etc.)
* Ensure that the right interpreter environment is chosen
* Run all cells

Happy training!
